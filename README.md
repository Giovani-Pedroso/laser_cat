  <h1>Create a cat toy for them to leave you alone</h1>
  <br>
  Cats are cute, no one can deny that, but they can also be very active
  and play with what they shouldn't R.I.P my headphones and usb cables,
  and if they want to play they will play and that can be a problem when
  you have an important project to finish so i made a very simple arduino
  project with parts that were lying around to entertain the kitties
  while you are working in that important project.

  <h1>The circuit</h1>
  <br>
  The circuit is nothing fancy like I said before it was made with what
  I have on my shelves. The components are 2 servo motors (SG90) a laser
  diode, some male heads all this in a Bare Perforated Phenolic.

  <h1>The code</h1>
  <br>
  Unlike the circuit, the code is a bit complex and you can see it
  <a href="https://github.com/Giovani-Pedroso/laser_cat/blob/main/Arduino/Lazer_eng_ins.ino" target="_blank"> here</a> the code is all commented out so feel free to modify it as much as you like.
